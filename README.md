# Search Algorithms

The goal of this project was to solidify my knowledge of exactly how different search strategies work. I implemented each of the graph search algorithms including uninformed, informed and optimal search techniques.

In particular, the search strategies included in this project are:
- Depth-1st Search
- Breadth-1st Search
- Depth Limited Search with limit = 2
- Iterative deepening search
- Uniform-Cost Search
- Greedy Search (= Best-1st search)
- A*
- Hill Climnbing 
- Beam Search

All the text file shows output of different search methods, path approached and finally the path found from start to goal using various search strategies.
